#Bit - Binary digit. smallest increment of data on a computer. A bit can hold only one of two values: 0 or 1
#Byte - The basic unit to measure computer storage and processing. 1 Byte encode a character from the ASCII character set. 1 Byte = 8 bit. Byte > KB > MB > GB > TB
#Encoding - Way to represent a character in binary digits. An encoding must follow a specific character set. character set - ASCII, Unicode (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32) 
#Fixed-Width encoding - ASCII (7 bits or 1 bytes), UTF-32(32 bits or 4 bytes)
#Variable-Width encoding - UTF-8(8 bit to 32 bit) , UTF-16 (16 bit to 32 bit)
#Hard Drive - A hard drive is basically the computer’s storage. Standard Interface used to connect hard drives to computer system - Parallel ATA (IDE/EIDE), serial ATA(SATA)
#Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) - Standard Interface for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices.
#HDD VS SDD - Hard disk drive spinning disks consume more power compare to solid-state drive.Data access is much faster in SSD compare to HDD.
#Drive is a physical block disk. For example: /dev/sda
#Partition is the futher division of drive into logical block.
#Once partition is formatted & mounted is called volumes.
#Filesystem is a method and data structure that decides how data is stored and retrieved.
#CPU is given to tasks in time slices. iostat
#Vertical scaling refers to adding more resources (CPU/RAM/DISK) to your server (database or application server is still remains one) as on demand.
#Horizontal Scaling means adding more nodes(or physical machine) to your server or database.
#IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a TCP/IP network and its unique for each device and no two devices can have same IP address.
#Hostname is a domain name assigned to a host computer. It's much easier to remember than an IP address. Two devices can have same hostname.

#Service is a process or group of processes(commonly known as daemons) running continuously in the background to serve some functionality, waiting for requests to come in.
#SSL certificates are what enable websites to move from HTTP to HTTPS, which is more secure. SSL enable verification, encryption of web traffic.
#SSL certificate includes domain name, Associated subdomains, certificate authority details, Issue & Expiration date, The public key (the private key is kept secret).
#Proxy server are intermediary server separating end-user clients from the destinations they browse. Proxy server translates traffic between networks or protocols. 
#Proxy server provide load balancing, privacy, or security and also masking the true origin of the request to the resource server.
#Reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and receives all the requests before they reach to destination server.
#Firewall monitors incoming and outgoing traffic and decide whether to allow or block specific traffic based on defined security rules.

#Shell is a Command Line Interpreter that takes commands from the keyboard and passes them to the kernel for performing.
#LILO is linux boot loader provides fast boot of os. GRUB & ELILO is a famous alternative used by many distribution.
#Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. When RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space
#Component of Linux os -  Kernel, Shell, GUI, System utilities, Application software.
#Minimun 2 disc partition requires for linux OS - one for filesystem, os, files other one for swap memory.
#Types of shell - Bourne shell, Bourne again shell, Korn shell, C shell, Z shell, fish shell

What file is used during login on Linux?

step 1 > /etc/passwd						#User account information.Login name and shell is looked up in a file. also /etc/shadow to crack encrypted password. 
step 2 > /etc/profile or /etc/bash.bashrc			#Linux system wide environment and other startup scripts. It is used by all users with bash, ksh, sh shell.
step 3 > .profile or .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile  	#user-specific files. For non login shell .bashrc is executed instead of .bash_profile. When you type username and password
								via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed to configure your shell.

Difference between hard link and soft(symbolic) link.

Hard Link -
Hard link acts as a copy (mirrored) of the selected file.
If the original file is deleted, the hard link to the file will still contain the data of that file.
Hard link assigned to the same Inode value as the original.
Cannot create a hard link for a directory
It cannot be used across file systems.

ln <file> <Hard link name>

Soft Link
A soft link acts as a shortcut to the file name. It contains the path for original file and not the contents
If the original file is deleted, the soft linked file will not work correctly (called hanging link).
Soft link has separate Inode value.
can reate a soft link for a files as well as directory.
It can be used across file systems.

ln -s <file or folder> <Soft link name>

Linux command to set default permission to newly created files and folder?

umask is the linux command used to set default permission to newly created files and folder. configured at /etc/profile or /etc/bash.bashrc
umask is the value that is subtracted from the 666 (rw-rw-rw-) permissions when creating new files, or from 777 (rwxrwxrwx) when creating new directories. 022
is default umask value. default permission for file - 644 & directory - 755
commands ---

#umask is the linux command used to set default permission to newly created files and folder.
umask					#display umask value
umask 044             			#to set umask. result in 622 default permission to file & 733 default permission to folder.
cd $HOME/.bashrc | vi .bashrc		#to change it for specific user.

string2=${string:$index2}
echo $string1$replacement$string2 
}

OR

#!/bin/bash
string_index(){
string=$1
index1=$2
index2=`echo $index1 + 2 | bc`
string1=$(echo $string | cut -c -$index1)
string2=$(echo $string | cut -c $index2-)
replacement='*'
echo $string1$replacement$string2

How to limit the access to a user in linux?

We can limit users access to linux system using restricted shell i.e rbash

#login with root user or sudo access
#Edit default shell as resricted shell for the user.
ln -s /bin/bash /bin/rbash or cp /bin/bash /bin/rbash
useradd -s /bin/rbash <user_name>
usermod -s /bin/rbash <user_name>

#edit .bash_profile and set PATH variable to $HOME/bin. So it look for executable only in $HOME/bin path.
mkdir $HOME/bin								#Make bin folder in $HOME directory
vi $HOME/.bash_profile							#Modify the PATH variable to PATH=$HOME/bin

#create link for commands the user can run.
ln -s /bin/date $HOME/bin/date
ln -s /bin/ls $HOME/bin/ls
ln -s /bin/mkdir $HOME/bin/mkdir
ln -s /bin/ping $HOME/bin/ping

Now login with user id and verify.

loops in Linux?

for i in `cat $list`; do
    echo item: $i
done

------------------------

while [ $COUNT -lt 10 ]; do
    echo The counter value is $COUNT
    let COUNT+=1
done

-----------------------

until [ $COUNT -lt 10 ]; do
    echo The counter value is $COUNT
    let COUNT-=1
done

[ NOTE : In while , the loop executes as long as the condition is true; in until , it runs as long as the condition is false. ]

By default, a new file and a new directory that is being created will have how many links?

New file contains one link. 
New directory contains two links. Every directory has a link to itself and its parent
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Differentiate between ‘ and ” and ` quotes

V='some substrings grouped together'  # don't support substitution of variable. only string assignment
X="Put $V to make a longer string"    # substitution of variable and then assignment
Y=`date`                              # run command, assign its output
